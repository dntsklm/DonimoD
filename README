About

Briefly
-------

DonimoD is Domino game variant played versus computer or human.

Fully
-----

DonimoD is a variant of a Domino game played with Double Six tiles
versus computer or human opponent on the same device or the Internet
with a web-browser.

To play, one does not need to have connection to the Internet. Copy
the game files to a device, open index.html with a web-browser and
play with computer or nearby friend at any time.

If the game-play is the main concern, then the documentation in the
actual game is to be read. It includes description of the game, its
rules and limits.

More detailed documentation than the one for playing is present as
well. For it, please read on.

Configuration
=============

Server Requirements
-------------------

The below versions, or probably higher too, would do.

Apache 2.2
MySQL 5.1
PHP 5.3

Values to Change
----------------

The following donimod.php values to be changed:
define("DB_HOST", "<YOURS>");
define("DB_USER", "<YOURS>");
define("DB_PASS", "<YOURS>");
define("DB_NAME", "<YOURS>");

The following error.php value to be changed:
define("EMAIL_TO", "email@example.com");

Additionally, .htaccess file should be modified according to specific
settings of a web server system at hand.

Development
===========

The source code of the program in src directory is the development
version: client and server code has settings that are useful for
development but are not suitable for production. Please view the next
section how to prepare src for production.

In donimod.js code, the function prefix "one" refers to one device
used to play. This is the case for games with computer opponent or
human opponent with whom the single device is shared to play. The
function prefix "two" refers to two devices which players use to play
with each other through the Internet (or any network within which the
DonimoD server is hosted).

Production
==========

To prepare the production version of the program, one needs to remove
everything between the two comment "//DEV//" (without double-quotes)
lines (and including them).

To do the removal conveniently, one may use Perl script at:
https://github.com/dntsklm/remove_dev_pairs

With it, the following one-liner, executed at src directory, will
remove development lines from the files which have them:
find -type f -exec <remove_dev_pairs.pl path-name> \{\} +

Web-browsers
============

Old web-browsers, especially proprietary IE9 and below, are not
supported. Virtually everything else more modern than that
web-browser, should work.
