Timers as Approximate Cron
==========================

Server includes an attempt to be an approximate "cron" substitute,
which may be used when there are no other way to schedule a procedure
in time.

The triggering of a schedule happens as follows. On server execution,
a timer function is called. It uses a variable, which defines paths to
timer files and their delay times and callback function names.

Timer function gets timer file modification time. If the time between
the current time and the file modification time is bigger than the
delay time, the file modification time is set to the current time and
the callback function is called.

Time resolution is 1 second.

Since the server code is executed at random times and the process is
not persistent, the called callback function would detect something
that it might track within the set delay time plus a second (the
fastest) and a double of the set delay time or at any later time when
the server runs (the slowest).

The following is two example diagrams of the fastest and slowest
detection times, when the callback function is called exactly at every
delay time expiration. There:
"C" is the time of a callback function call,
"S" is the time of the start of something, and
"D" is the time of detection of the something.

Fastest detection:
C----------------C----------------C
		S-----------------D
Slowest detection:
C----------------C----------------C
S---------------------------------D
